Basics

git clone repository_path
    --> takes remote git repository and clones it locally by creating the folder with same name as repository name

##### Happens in succession #####
git status
    --> tells us what file has been modified since the last time I pulled the changes remotely
    --> Good way to check what I might want to include in my next push back to github
    
git add filename_to_add
    --> adds the file to staged
    
git commit -m "message_you_want_to_put"
    --> this commits the file to staged
    --> Also add the message so that others can know what was committed
    
git push
    --> to push the local changes to online repository
####################################

git pull
    --> takes all the changes that are living on the repository remotely and gets them locally
    --> Basically updates the local copy with online changes
    
Branch concept
  --> When other members of my team are working on the same file and I don't want my work to interfere with other's work, we create a branch
  
  
  - git branch
      --> to know which branch I am on
      
  - git checkout -b branch_name_that_is_descriptive
      --> Adds a new branch and switches to new branch that is created
      --. names tells what changes we are going to make
      
  - git checkout branch_name
      --> Switches to the branch name
      
  - git merge
      --> merges branch with main branch
